-- We have two staff members, with Staff IDs 1 and 2. We want to give a bonus to the staff member that handled the most payments. (Most in terms of number of payments processed, not total dollar amount).
-- How many payments did each staff member handle and who gets the bonus?

SELECT staff_id, COUNT(payment_id)
FROM payment
GROUP BY staff_id;
